# Sticky Bits

> Sticky stuff for webpages

## Why?

Because. =] Also, Sticky Bits is meant to do one thing - stick navs or other block elements to the top of the browser when scrolling vertically. 

## TODOS

- Add throttling &/or debouncing for window scroll & resize (maybe) or maybe remove window functionality all together to allow you to control that
- Support bottom & stop sticky positioning (maybe)
- Support on, of or destroy (maybe)
