# Sticky Bits

> Sticky stuff for webpages

## Why?

Because. =] Also, Sticky Bits is meant to do one thing - stick stuff when scrolling vertically (navs & stuff like that).  

## TODOS

- Last one will be to introduce a \*_garage door_
- Add throttling for window scroll (maybe)
- Add debounce for window resize (probably)

## First lil' demo
