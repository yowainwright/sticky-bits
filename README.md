# Sticky Bits

> Sticky stuff for webpages

## Why?

Because. =] Also, Sticky Bits is meant to do one thing - stick stuff when scrolling vertically (navs & other stuff like that).  

## TODOS

- Last one will be to introduce a \*_garage door_
- Add throttling for window scroll (maybe)
- Add debounce for window resize (probably)

\* *The Garage Door*: On the web there are a lot of sticky bits that show _back_ up when a reader `scrolls up`. It was recently pointed out to me that this often hinders a reader's experience when a reader is reading & accidently `scrolls up`. The Garage Door will be built to show the stick bit _only_ the amount that has been `scrolled up`. It will function similarily to a _garage door_.
