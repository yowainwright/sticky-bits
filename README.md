# Sticky Bits

> Sticky stuff for webpages

## Why?

Because. =] Also, Sticky Bits is meant to do one thing - stick navs or other block elements when scrolling vertically. 

*Update:* Sticky bits can be setup for hijacking `window scroll` which can result is high quality device scrolling. 

## TODOS

- Add throttling for window scroll (maybe)
- Add debounce for window resize (probably)
